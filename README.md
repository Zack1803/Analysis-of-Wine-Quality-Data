# Analysis-of-Wine-Quality-Data
A wine quality data analysis project intended to predict the wine quality on a scale of 0-11. The dataset used for this analysis is obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository. You can find the details of the dataset and its metadata here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine. In this project, we analysed and compared the performance of 5 different machine learning models for Wine Quality rate prediction based on 12 features. We considered accuracy as the evaluation metric. The accuracy reflects the ratio of correctly classified cases. 

The following is the list of models that we implemented:
<li> Linear Regression</li>
<li> Logistic Regression</li>
<li> Decision Tree</li>
<li> Random Forest </li>
<li> Regression Tree</li>
